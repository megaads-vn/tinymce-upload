## Getting started with Composer and PSR-4

Initial gist can be found at: [https://gist.github.com/pavlakis/8810829]

This is a very basic getting started example for setting up a basic project using PSR-4 and using composer's autoloader to run the tests.

There are 5 files in total:

1. MyApp/composer.json

2. MyApp/src/Http/Request.php

3. MyApp/tests/Http/RequestTest.php

4. MyApp/tests/bootstrap.php

5. MyApp/tests/phpunit.xml.dist
